\title{Seeing values for LSST strategy simulations}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}

The \texttt{opsim4} operations simulation program for the LSST astronomical
survey uses a database of seeing values covering the range of times to
be simulated. I describe the creation of such a database using Dual
Image Motion Monitor (DIMM) data collected at Cerro Pachon from
2014-03-17 to 2018-03-21. This data has significant gaps, so I model
the data and generate artificial data in the gaps according to the
model. The model consists of a sinusoidal variation with a period of
one year, an autoregressive (AR1) model for variations in mean seeing
from one night to the next, and another AR1 model for variations on a
5 minute timescale. I create two databases according to this
procedure, one based on DIMM data from 2008-01-01 to 2018-12-31, and
the other for 2005-01-01 to 2015-12-31, and run \texttt{opsim4} simulations
using each. I also run an otherwise identical simulation using the
default seeing database. The results show a variation in mean point
spread function (PSF) width with right ascension with peak-to-peak
differences of 17\% and 16\%, respectively, compared to a 2\%
variation in the default seeing database.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a telescope currently
under construction on Cerro Pachon, in Chile. It will spend 10 years
performing an astronomical survey, taking repeated images across a
large fraction of the sky visible from Cerro Pachon. It will take
images of any given area of the sky multiple times, spread across many
nights, so that transient objects may be detected and characterized.

Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere causes short time-scale variations
in the index of refraction of the air. These variations place limits
on the sharpness of astronomical images taken by telescopes on the
surface of the Earth; this limit is called the ``seeing'', typically
measured as the angular full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the image
of a point source, the ``point spread function'' (PSF), that would be
taken by an ideal instrument. The seeing is a property of the weather,
and as such is correlated with the location, time of year, and
transient weather patterns. \textcite{2009PASP..121..922E}, for example,
measure a significant variation in seeing with time of year at Cerro
Tololo, a site $\sim10 \mbox{ km}$ from Cerro Pachon.

The \texttt{opsim4} operations simulation computer program generates a database
of exposures plausible for an execution of the survey. Each exposure in
the database includes several parameters, including the time the
exposure was taken, the depth of the image (the brightness of the
faintest objects detected at a given signal to noise ratio), and the
delivered point spread function (PSF) full width at half maximum
(FWHM). The LSST project and science groups use these databases of
simulated exposures to evaluate the data quality that would result
from different operations strategies. Such evaluations can then be
used both to select among candidate observing strategies, and set
expectations for the scientific usefulness of the LSST data set.

To calculate the depth and PSF FWHM of each simulated exposures, the
simulator must have a value for the atmospheric seeing at the time the
image was taken. It takes these values from a simple database table, which
provides atmospheric seeing values at 5 minute intervals.

The seeing data is not only used to calculate the data quality values
for each exposure in the final database; it may also affect the
scheduling of the exposures themselves. Some science programs are more
sensitive the the seeing than others, and the scheduler can
use this data in its choice of which exposure to take at a given
time. For example, a less urgent exposure needed for one program may
be taken in preference to a more urgent exposure needed for another,
if the seeing is too poor for the data to be useful for the more
urgent exposure, but adequate for the less urgent one.

The details of the seeing database used by \texttt{opsim4} can therefore affect
the results in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The global quality of the survey is strongly affected by the
    contents of the seeing database. If the average seeing in the
    seeing database is worse, the average delivered PSF FWHM in the
    images that comprise the survey will be worse, as will the depth
    of the survey.
  \item The accessible area in the sky varies with a period of one
    year, which corresponds to the yearly seasonal variation in the
    seeing. For example, the same area on the sky can be imaged in
    January every year, and a different area every July. If the seeing
    is better in January than in July of every year, then the data
    quality in the area of sky accessible in January will be better
    than that accessible in July.
  \item The autocorrelation of seeing over time will also affect the
    data quality of light curves of transient objects: if the seeing
    is weakly correlated over timescale similar to the duration of a
    transient event, then the quality of different points on the light
    curve will be uncorrelated. On the other hand, if the
    autocorrelation of the seeing over time is strong on the timescale
    of the event, then it is more likely for the seeing to be either
    good or poor over the whole duration of the event.
  \item The autocorrelation of the seeing over time on timescales
    similar to the time between one exposure and the next will affect
    the ability of the scheduler to react appropriately to changes in
    seeing. 
    
\end{itemize}

The seeing conditions on Cerro Pachon have been monitored since 2004
using a Dual Image Motion Monitor, or DIMM. A DIMM measures the
position of a star through two neighboring paths through the
atmosphere, typically separated by $\sim10 \mbox{ cm}$. The difference
in positions between these two paths indicates the variability in
measured position due to turbulence on that spatial scale. The Fried
parameter, the diameter of a circular aperture over which the RMS
wavefront error induced by atmospheric turbulence is one radian, can
be derived directly from DIMM measurements [\cite{1965JOSA...55.1427F,
    1987PASP...99.1360M, 2002PASP..114.1156T}].  The archive of DIMM
data for Cerro Pachon records seeing values derived for $0.5 \micron$
light using a Kolmogorov turbulence model, which may be
pessimistic. \cite{2002PASP..114.1156T} provides a formula for
approximating a more realistic von K\'arm\'an model, provided one can
estimate the outer scale of the turbulence.

The default seeing database used by \texttt{opsim4} version 081217 was
artificially generated from a model derived from a much more limited
set of data from the Cerro Pachon DIMM, and repeats with a period of
two years.

Observing strategy simulation for the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
[\cite{2016MNRAS.460.1270D}] had a similar
requirement. \texttt{obstac} [\cite{2014ASPC..485...77N}], the DES operations
scheduler and simulator, used seeing data sets generated using a model
derived from data from the DIMMs on Cerro
Tololo [\cite{2012ASPC..461..201N}]. The model used by \texttt{obstac} included
both a seasonal component and a short timescale autoregressive model,
producing seeing values on 5 minute intervals.

Plots in this note were generated using \texttt{jupyter} notebooks
that can be found in github:

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The following procedure was followed in generating new seeing
databases and exploring their effects on \texttt{opsim4} simulations:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Obtain the Cerro Pachon DIMM data, and explore it
    interactively, as provided. See section~\ref{sec:dimm}.
  \item For each DIMM measurement, calculate the Fried parameter,
    $r_{0}$, and seeing based on the von K\'arm\'an model using the
    correction given in \cite{2002PASP..114.1156T} and an outer scale
    of $\mathcal{L}_{0} = 30$ meters, based on the measurement
    reported in \cite{2000ApOpt..39.5415Z}.
  \item Resample the DIMM data to obtain a data set sampled on 5
    minute intervals.
  \item Interactively explore long time-scale variability, and fit
    a sine with a period of 1 year to the nightly mean value of
    $\log(r_{0})$.
  \item Interactively explore the nightly residuals of $\log(r_{0})$
    (after subtraction of the seasonal model), and fit the residuals
    using autoregressive (AR1) models on each uninterrupted sequence
    of consecutive nights with DIMM data. Derive a global AR1 model
    for nightly residuals using a weighted average of the parameters
    as derived from each sequence of nights.
  \item Interactively explore the short time-scale residuals of
    $\log(r_{0})$ (after subtraction of the nightly mean values), and fit the
    residuals using a second autoregressive (AR1) model on each
    consecutive sequence of values in the resampled data. (Gaps
    in DIMM data during the night result in breaks between sequences
    in the resampled data.) Derive a global AR1 model for short
    time-scale residuals using a weighted average of the parameters as
    derived from each sequence.
  \item Generate two seeing databases, using two different subsets of
    the Cerro Pachon DIMM data. Use the derived models to fill in gaps
    in the DIMM data with values randomly generated according to the
    derived seasonal, nightly, and short-timescale AR models.
  \item Run three \texttt{opsim4} simulations: one using the default seeing
    database, and one for each of the newly generates seeing
    databases.
  \item Compare the results of these three simulations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cerro Pachon DIMM data}
\label{sec:dimm}

\cite{ebustos} kindly provided an the Cerro Pachon DIMM data in the
form of two text tables, each with a timestamp and an
airmass-corrected seeing value for a wavelength of 0.5 \micron,
derived using a Kolmogorov seeing
model.

Figure~\ref{fig:monthly-raw-dimm} shows the variation in
reported FWHM seeing values with time. The regular extremes of good
and poor seeing, shortly after the start and midpoint of each year,
match well with anecdotal experience, and indicate a significant
seasonal component. There are also noticeable long-term trends, but on
a timescale comparable to or greater than the range of the data, so no
attempt is made to model these longer term trends here. This feature
is also evident in the autocorrelation function of the nightly means,

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{monthly_raw_dimm.png}
  \caption{Points show the mean FWHM reported by the DIMM for each
    month. The upper and lower bounds of the dark gray band are
    LOWESS smoothed curves derived from the 1st and 3rd quartiles of
    this data.}
  \label{fig:monthly-raw-dimm}
\end{figure*}

The Fried parameter, $r_0$, was then calculated for each reported
value by inverting equation~5 of \cite{2002PASP..114.1156T}.
Figure~\ref{fig:raw-r0-dist} shows the
distribution of measured values for the $r_0$, in meters (left) and
$\log(r_0)$ (right), together with best fit normal
distributions. Neither distribution is precisely normal, but $\log(
r_0)$ is noticeably closer to normal.

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{raw_r0_dist.png}
  \caption{The distribution of the Fried parameter, $r_0$ in meters
    (left), and $\log(r_0)$ (right), together with best fit normal
    distributions.}
  \label{fig:raw-r0-dist}
\end{figure*}

%% The
%% nightly autocorrelation of the nightly mean values of $r_0$
%% (figure~\ref{fig:raw-dimm-autocorr}) also shows the seasonal effect.

%%     confidence intervals for uncorrelated data.}
%%   \label{fig:raw-dimm-autotorr}
%% \end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:random-nights-dimm} shows the time series of DIMM
measurements for three nights, chosen randomly from among nights with
good DIMM coverage.

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{random_nights_dimm.png}
  \caption{The time series of DIMM
measurements for three nights, chosen randomly from among nights with

  \label{fig:random-nights-dimm}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Seasonal fit}
\label{sec:seasonal}

The first stage in creating a model for the seeing data was to fit a
sine curve (plus a constant) with a period of one year to
$\log(r_0)$ (equation~\ref{eq:seasonal-sine}).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:seasonal-sine}
\log(r_0) = a + c \times \cos\left( (\mbox{day} - d) \times \frac{2\pi}{365.24217} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l } \hline
  $a$ & -0.9170 & corresponds to a seeing of 0.83'' (Kolmogorov)\\
  $c$ & 0.048 & corresponds to a peak to peak amplitude of 0.18''\\
  $d$ & 18.8 & best seeing on January 18, worst on July 21 \\ \hline
  Nightly $\mbox{L1}$ & 0.2 \\
  Nightly $e$ & 0.084 \\ \hline
  5 minute $\mbox{L1}$ & 0.7 \\
  5 minute $e$ & 0.052 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameters for the least squares fit of Pachon DIMM data to
  equation~\ref{eq:seasonal-sine}, the nightly autoregressive model,
  and the short time-scale autoregressive model.}\label{tab:fit-params}
\end{center}
\end{table}

A sine was chosen as the simplest periodic
function. Table~\ref{tab:fit-params} shows the best fit
values. Figure~\ref{fig:monthly-boxplot} shows the distribution of the
mean $\log(r_0)$ values for each month, before and after subtraction
of the seasonal model. Before subtraction of the model, months near
the middle of the year have obviously worse seeing, an effect not
visible after subtraction. Figure~\ref{fig:seasonal-sub-autocorr}
shows the autocorrelation functions of the monthly mean $\log(r_0)$
values. The seasonal effect is again prominent before subtraction of
the seasonal fit. Longer timescale variations are still apparent after
subtraction of the seasonal model, but there is no obvious periodic
structure.

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{monthly_boxplot.png}
  \caption{The top plot shows the distributions of mean monthly values
    for each month. The blue bar shows the median mean value for that
    month, the box the 1st and 3rd quartiles, and the whiskers the
    full range. The bottom plot shows the distributions after
    subtraction of the seasonal fit to $\log(r_0)$.}
  \label{fig:monthly-boxplot}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{seasonal_sub_autocorr.png}
  \caption{The upper and lower plots show the autocorrelation function
  of the mean $\log(r_0)$ by month, before and after subtraction of
  the seasonal model, respectively. The solid and dashed gray lines show
  the 95\% and 99\% ranges for uncorrelated data.}
  \label{fig:seasonal-sub-autocorr}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Nightly variation in seeing}
\label{sec:nightly-variation}

After subtraction of the seasonal variation in $\log(r_0)$,
significant night to night correlation remains. The modeled here as a
first-order autoregressive process [\cite{cryer_time_2008}], also
referred to as an AR(1) process or a damped random walk
[\cite{2009ApJ...698..895K}], described in
equation~\ref{eq:ar1}. Here, $y_t$ is the difference between the mean
$\log(r_0)$ on that night and the seasonal model for
$\log(r_0)$. $\mbox{L1}$ is the regressive term, the model parameter
that represents the correlation between one night and the next, and
$e_t$ is the ``innovation'', analogous to the standard deviation of
step sizes in a random walk.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ar1}
y_t = \mbox{L1} \times y_{t-1} + e_t
\end{equation}

There are many nights in the Cerro Pachon DIMM data set with no data,
either due to poor weather or equipment failure.  The tool used to
fit the AR1 model, from the python \texttt{statsmodels} module
[\cite{seabold2010statsmodels}], does not handle missing data. To fit
the AR1 model, I divided the full data set into sequences of
consecutive nights without missing data, performed separate fits on
each sequence, and accepted the mean values provided by the models,
weighted according to the reported uncertainty in each model
fit. Table~\ref{tab:fit-params} lists the resultant fit parameters.

The distribution values in a sequence of points generated by an AR1
process is a normal distribution with a variance given by
equation~\ref{eq:ar1var}[\cite{cryer_time_2008} eqn. 4.3.3].

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ar1var}
\sigma_y^2 = \frac{\sigma_e^2}{1-\mbox{L1}^2}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:night-ar1-dist} shows the expected distribution given
the fit model parameters over-plotted over the actual histogram of
$\log(r_0)$ - seasonal fit $\log(r_0)$. The distribution expected from
the AR1 fit is sharper than the measured one, and do not capture the
tail on the low-$\log(r_0)$ side of the distribution. The later is a
fundamental limitation of the model. The sharper distribution likely
arises from the fit of a collection of sub-sequences of nights, rather
than a full, uninterrupted data set: figure~\ref{fig:monthly-raw-dimm}
clearly shows variations on timescales of months to years, too long to
be captured by the sub-sequences of nights to which the AR1 model was
fit.

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{night_ar1_dist.png}
  \caption{The histogram of differences between nightly mean
    $\log(r_0)$ and the seasonal fit, over-plotted by the result that
    would be expected by the fit AR1 model.}
  \label{fig:night-ar1-dist}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Short timescale variation in seeing}
\label{sec:short-variation}

In addition to varying on a nightly basis, seeing varies on much
shorter timescales. The short-timescale variations are modeled using
an AR1 model as well. The raw DIMM data is sampled irregularly,
slightly more frequently than once every 5 minutes. I therefore
resample the points onto exact 5 minute intervals, and divide in into
sub-sequences of consecutive uninterrupted exposures, similar to the
procedure for nightly data. Table~\ref{tab:fit-params} lists the
resultant fit parameters.

\subsection{Correction from Kolmogorov to von K\'arm\'an turbulence}
\label{sec:vkcorr}

The raw data provided by the Cerro Pachon DIMM archive provides seeing
data calculated using a Kolmogorov model for the turbulence in the
atmosphere. This data was used to work backward to the Fried
parameter, $r_0$, which was then modeled. To obtain simulation seeing
values from the $r_0$ model, I use the approximation given in
equation~\ref{eq:ktovk}, provided by \cite{2002PASP..114.1156T}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ktovk}
\left( \frac{\mbox{FWHM}_{vK}}{\mbox{FWHM}_{K}} \right)^2
\approx 1 - 2.183 \left( \frac{r_0}{\mathcal{L}_0} \right)^{0.356}
\end{equation}

I use a value of $\mathcal{L}_0 = 30$ meters, based on the
value of $28.4^{+25.0}_{-13.3}$ meters reported by
\cite{2000ApOpt..39.5415Z} for Cerro Pachon. This corresponds to a 22\%
improvement in seeing when converting from a Kolmogorov to a
von~K\'arm\'an turbulence model and a typical value of $r_0$, but the
range given is from 18\% to 30\%. Furthermore, the value reported was
measured data from only a few nights of data, and is likely to be
strongly dependent on weather.

\subsection{Seeing data generation}
\label{sec:data-generation}

Much of the data to be used by an \texttt{opsim4} simulation can be copied
directly from the historical DIMM data, after conversion from a
Kolmogorov to a von~K\'arm\'an turbulence model and application of an
offset in time by an integer number of years. The gaps can then be
filled in using the model.

For sequences of nights with no data, mean values for each night are
calculated using the seasonal model, equation~\ref{eq:ar1}, the last
night of data with DIMM data, and randomly generated values of
$e_t$. For sequences of short time-scale (5 minute interval) points,
artificial data is generated similarly, using the nightly mean, the
last good DIMM data point, and random values of $e_t$.

Two different seeing databases were generated: one using a 14 year
offset (such that the 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z data point in the data set
is copied from the 2008-01-01T00:00:00Z DIMM data), and one using a 17
year offset, such that we take full advantage of all available DIMM
data. Note that there is overlap between the DIMM data used by these
two database, so the results are not uncorrelated.

\subsection{\texttt{opsim4} simulations}
\label{sec:simulations}

Three separate simulations were run using \texttt{opsim4-081217}, as
distributed from \url{https://hub.docker.com/r/oboberg/opsim4/}. Each
simulation was run for a full 10-year LSST survey, with the default
configuration except for the seeing database.

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{des70\_2001}] a 10-year simulation using the seeing database
    provided in the \texttt{opsim4-081217} container, used as a reference.
  \item[\texttt{des70\_2012}] a simulation using the
    \texttt{simsee\_pachon6} seeing database, which uses DIMM data
    from 2008-01-01 to 2018-12-31 to to simulate 2022-01-01 to
    2032-12-31. This simulation is otherwise identical to
    \texttt{des70\_2001}.
  \item[\texttt{des70\_2013}] a simulation using the
    \texttt{simsee\_pachon7} seeing database, which uses DIMM data
    from 2005-01-01 to 2015-12-31 to to simulate 2022-01-01 to
    2032-12-31. This simulation is otherwise identical to
    \texttt{des70\_2001}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Figure~\ref{fig:simseecomp} shows the seeing as a function of time, as
recorded in the databases produced by each of the three runs of
\texttt{opsim4}. The two year periodicity of the seeing that results
from the default two year input database is apparent in the leftmost
plot in the figure. Yearly periodicity, expected from the seasonal
variation in the DIMM data and model, is apparent in the plots from
the other two runs. The average seeing in the default model is also
better than either of the revised simulations: the mean FWHM in the
revised simulations are 13\% and 14\% wider than the default.


\begin{figure*}

    produced by \texttt{simsee}.} 
  \label{fig:simseecomp}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:simseemaps} shows maps of the mean seeing in the LSST
wide-fast-deep (WFD) survey from each simulation. Degradation is
apparent near the northern and southern edges of all three
simulations. This is expected, because these areas are never at low
airmass from the Cerro Pachon. The seeing in the default simulation
shows no obvious trends otherwise. In the simulations that use the
revised seeing databases, however, there is an obvious large scale
trend with R.A. This same trend is also apparent in the plot of the
mean seeing as a function of R.A. in the left plot of
figure~\ref{fig:seelimra}: seeing in fields that transit when the
seeing is poor ($180\degree < \mbox{R.A.} < 330\degree$) have a mean
FWHM 17\% wider than those that transit when the seeing is good
($60\degree < \mbox{R.A.} < 150\degree$).

  \label{fig:simseemaps}

The variation in seeing corresponds to a variation in depth, shown in
figure~\ref{fig:simdepthmaps} and the right-hand plot in
figure~\ref{fig:seelimra}: the $5-\sigma$ magnitude limit in fields
that transit when the seeing is poor ($180\degree < \mbox{R.A.} <
330\degree$) is $\sim 0.12$ shallower than those that transit when the
seeing is good ($60\degree < \mbox{R.A.} < 150\degree$).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The use of real seeing data (and a more elaborate model for
times when such data is not available) in operations simulations
demonstrates a significant, large angular scale variation in seeing
(and therefore depth) using the current strategy. The impact of this
variation on science results needs to be carefully evaluated and, if
warranted by the science, adjustments to the strategy made to mitigate
these effects.

Such mitigation strategies will necessarily come at a cost. The
current strategy is designed to observe fields when they are near
transit. Such a strategy optimizes the quality of data taken at any
given time: a field observed near transit at a given declination will
have a better FWHM than another at the same declination, but further
from transit. Observing fields dear transit, however, necessarily maps
time of observation directly to sidereal time, which is correlated
with time of year, and therefore the seasonal variation in seeing.

This correlation can be reduced by observing fields when they are
further from transit, depending on seeing conditions. For example, the
strategy could be modified to select fields in the
($180\degree < \mbox{R.A.} < 330\degree$) range whenever such fields
are at an airmass better than some threshold and the seeing is better
than average, and in the ($60\degree < \mbox{R.A.} < 150\degree$)
range when it is worse than average. Such a strategy will tend to
even out the extremes in the variation. However (if the strategy
maintains the distribution in declination) these exposures will be at
higher airmasses than those that would have been taken at transit,
which will degrade the overall mean image quality.

A compromise will need to be made: the effect on image quality is not
linear with zenith distance (or time from transit), but is, rather,
shallow very close to transit, but degrades more rapidly as the angle
increases: a mild deviation from the transiting strategy may only have
a mild effect on the mean image quality.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

Although an improvement over the default seeing database, the revised
seeing databases presented here leave significant room for
improvement. Some refinements that should be explored include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Modeling the long term (multi-year) trends in the DIMM
  seeing. Currently the model regresses to the average seeing (that
  the specific time of year) quickly, rather than keeping the
  multi-year trend apparent in the data.

\item Rigorous evaluation of higher-order ARMA models using a formal
  criteria (either Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or a Bayesian
  Information Criterion (BIC))[\cite{cryer_time_2008} pp. 130-132],
  rather than the AR1 model used here. The AR1 model was selected due
  to its simplicity and apparent effectiveness after informal
  exploration; additional terms and/or a moving average component may
  be warranted.

\item Model the short term, nightly, seasonal, and long term
  components as a single seasonal ARMA model, following the formalism
  described in \cite{cryer_time_2008} chapter 10. Rather than fit each
  element separately (as has been done here), this approach
  incorporates long-term effects by including additional terms in the
  autoregressive equation.
  
\item Modeling using a continuous ARMA model (CARMA)
  [\cite{brockwell_introduction_1996} pp. 344-348] rather than the
  discrete ARMA model used here. Such models are significantly more
  complex and lack the well developed software tools, but naturally
  handle the irregularly sampled nature of the DIMM data.

\item Creating a better model of the poor seeing tail in the
  distribution of seeing values, either as an additional component or
  by transforming the DIMM's $\log(r_0)$ distribution.

\item Interactive exploration and informal experience suggest that the
  seeing has a systematic variation with the time of night, in
  particular that the seeing is slightly worse shortly after
  sunset. This needs to be studied further, and perhaps modeled as
  well.
  
\end{itemize}

In addition to modeling the seeing, improved modeling of the effect of
clouds in survey data quality should also be studied.

Finally, observing strategy adjustments may need to be developed to
address non-uniformity introduced by seasonal seeing variations.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The full archive of data from the Cerro Tololo DIMM shows strong
seasonal variations, and larger mean values for the seeing, than are
present in the default input database used by the LSST \texttt{opsim4}
operations simulator. Inclusion of an updated seeing database is
therefore important for using \texttt{opsim4} to evaluate both the
overall survey quality and also large scale variation in seeing and
depth across the survey footprint.

In this directory, we will tabulate some info needed for the static science cases.

We agreed tabulate quantities for the new strategies, so that we can identify patterns (strategies that behave in similar ways) and group the strategies so as to reduce the amount of forecasting needed.  Below are tables for this purpose.

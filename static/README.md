In this directory, we will tabulate some info needed for the static science cases.

We agreed tabulate quantities for the new strategies, so that we can identify patterns (strategies that behave in similar ways) and group the strategies so as to reduce the amount of forecasting needed.  Below are tables for this purpose.

The "Photo-z quality" statistic is the ratio of the standard deviation of the IQR of (ztrue-zphot)/(1+zphot) for test set galaxies with 0.3<zphot<1.5 or 1.5<zphot<3 (calculated separately) for year X strategy Y, over that for year 10 baseline2018a. Thus, the photo-z quality column will give a quality with respect to the 10 year baseline.

The "median depth" mentioned here is i-band.  Studies that involve varying the time distributions between filters will require more sophisticated metrics, but just i-band is sufficient for these runs.

\section{Photometric Redshifts}\label{sec:pz}

An evaluation of how the photometric redshifts derived from LSST photometry will evolve over the 10 year survey, for a variety of observing strategies, is currently underway and being documented in this Overleaf draft: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/fgnvddbnrmgk}. It includes an analysis of the recently released results from the LSST Operations Simulator ({\tt OpSim}) and the Another LSST Telescope Scheduler ({\tt ALTSched}) software which consider changing the total area of the wide-fast-deep (WFD) component, changing how single visits are treated, and/or introducing ``rolling" (or ``concentrated'') cadences. That work demonstrates how many of the current LSST observing strategy simulations produce a similar overall photometric evolution, and would thus produce equivalent photo-$z$ results, and focuses on a thorough evaluation of the strategies that deviate significantly from the baseline. The ongoing analysis also explores more generic scenarios in which, e.g., 5\% of the total observing time is redistributed to or from each filter in turn.

A one page summary of our analysis of the {\tt OpSim} and {\tt ALTSched} results is provided in Section \ref{mlg_sec:pz_summary}. 

{\bf MLG notes:} more details could be added here, but for now it might be optimal to keep the full analysis in that Overleaf document since work is ongoing.

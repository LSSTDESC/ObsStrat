The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is an astronomical sky
survey designed to image $25000\square\degree$ of the sky (including
the entire southern hemisphere) in 6 different filters, repeatedly for
10 years. Such a data set will allow creation not only of a catalog of
objects in the covered area, but also the generation of light curves
of variable objects in the covered area. The LSST Dark Energy Science
Collaboration (DESC) formed to advise the LSST project on optimizing
the survey for cosmology, and prepare for and perform cosmological
analysis on this data set.

In the summer of 2018, the LSST project issued a call for white papers
to provide input on the effects of cadence and other survey strategy
considerations on science. Due to the tight constraints on the length
and format of responeses, the DESC Observing Strategy Task Force
(OSTF) composed a collection of supporting documents, with different
intended audiences, levels of refinement, and detail.

This document collects contributions from different analysis groups
intended for internal use, for example as a reference for writing more
refined documentation and as support for future work. It is intended to
be a dynamic document, tracking the active work of the analysis groups
as it progresses.

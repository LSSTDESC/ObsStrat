\section{Static probes}

\newcommand{\todorm}[1]{\textbf{#1}}

Here we present results for joint cosmological forecasts of the ``static'' probes: WL, LSS, and CL.
Unlike Section~\ref{sec:wl}, which focuses specifically on systematics mitigation for weak lensing,
this section focuses on dark energy constraining power.  The forecasting methodology follows
that in the DESC Science Requirements Document v1 \citep{DESCSRD2018}, though with modified
assumptions about the baseline LSST analysis for Y1 and Y10 based on the new strategies, and filling
in Y3 and Y6 forecasts as well.

\todorm{Say why Y3 and Y6.  Tie results to LSS, WL section results.}

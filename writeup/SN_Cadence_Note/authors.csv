# authors.csv
#
# While we wait for the LSST DESC publications system to generate files
# like this from its database, we'll need to edit authors.csv by hand.
# Below are some example entries.
#
# Notes:
#   - If someone has two affiliations, they get two rows, and the last
#     row is is used for their contribution.
#   - Try to make your one-sentence contribution statement as
#     informative as possible, so that it's clear who did what.
#   - The contribution statement is a _summary of your impact on the
#     project_, not a _timecard_. So, if you spent 90% of your time
#     debugging, but 10% of your time designing and implementing the
#     framework that then needed debugging, your statement should
#     emphasize the design and implementation rather than the debugging.
#   - BUG: mkauthlist cannot deal with empty rows, so please avoid them!
#   - BUG: contributions are re-formatted by mkauthlist into Title case,
#     removing all other capitalizations. Sorry about this!
#
# Example rows for you to adapt:

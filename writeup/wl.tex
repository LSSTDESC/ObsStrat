\section{Weak Lensing}\label{sec:wl}

The LSST provides an opportunity to mitigate WL systematics using the observing strategy. This opportunity was not possible in previous surveys because the LSST will be the first survey to dither at large scales (relative to the field of view) with a large number of exposures.

We analyzed how different OpSim runs perform with respect to the point-spread function (PSF) modeling errors and similar WL systematics as follows: (a) We create 50 million stars uniformly in the WFD areas of each survey, with cuts based on the coadded depth and dust extinction, consistently the LSS WG. (b) we model the PSF modeling errors at each star in each exposure as a 6\% radial error in the outer 20\% of field of view (and no error). We assume an average size error on the PSF model of . This model is realistically motivated by recent surveys (e.g. \cite{bosche2018}) (c) We average down the modeling errors across exposures via the 2nd moments for each star. (d) Propagate the averaged errors into bias on the cosmic shear using the $\rho$-statistics formulation (\cite{rowe2010} \cite{jarvis2016}). The code to recreate this analysis is available on GitHub \footnote{\url{https://github.com/hsnee/lsstpsf/blob/master/ModelErrorsNew.ipynb}}. 

There are several metrics that would contain similar information to that in our analysis: the distribution of angles pointing to the center of the field of view in each observation \footnote{\url{https://github.com/LSST-nonproject/sims\_maf\_contrib/blob/5fd4ad762509cab0b4e403d84f2e65ed1ad08c06/science/static/WeakLensing\_Focal\_Angle.ipynb}} from Peter Yoachim which returns the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test's D-statistic for this distribution of angles against a uniform distribution, the distribution of coadded-depth (high values and narrow distribution is best) the distribution of airmass (low values and narrow distribution is best), the distribution of seeing values (also low values and narrow distribution is best).

Table~\ref{table:WLSystematicsRankings} provides a ranking of the strategies. There are certain trends that can be seen from the table (or equivalently, from figure~\ref{fig:WLSystematicsRanking}): more visits in the main WFD survey are very useful for averaging down weak lensing systematics (whether achieved by smaller area, or shorter 20 second visits.) OpSim runs with more exposure to the galactic planes underperform. Runs with rolling cadence significantly underperform others, especially ones that have rolling cadence in all or most years. These are not surprising trends, since prioritizing uniformity in WFD over area increases and rolling strategies is what would essentially drive weak lensing systematics down.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{A ranking of the recent observing strategies with respect to weak lensing systematics, as explained in the text, for years 1 and 10. Repeated numbers are ties. $<N>_i^{(Y10)}$ is the number of observations an object sees on average after 10 years -- a simple metric that strongly correlates with the performance of an OpSim run, $<N>_i^{(Y10)}$ is typically higher for better-performing runs.}

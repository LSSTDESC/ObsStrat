abstract = {Mergers of neutron stars (NS+NS) or neutron stars and stellar mass black holes (NS+BS) eject a small fraction of matter with a sub-relativistic velocity. Upon rapid decompression nuclear density medium condenses into neutron rich nuclei, most of them radioactive. Radioactivity provides a long term heat source for the expanding envelope. A brief transient has the peak luminosity in the supernova range, and the bulk of radiation in the UV -- Optical domain. We present a very crude model of the phenomenon, and simple analytical formulae which may be used to estimate the parameters of a transient as a function of poorly known input parameters. The mergers may be detected with high redshift supernova searches as rapid transients, many of them far away from the parent galaxies. It is possible that the mysterious optical transients detected by Schmidt et al. (1998) are related to neutron star mergers as they typically have no visible host galaxy.},

abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is designed to provide an unprecedented optical imaging dataset that will support investigations of our Solar System, Galaxy and Universe, across half the sky and over ten years of repeated observation. However, exactly how the LSST observations will be taken (the observing strategy or "cadence") is not yet finalized. In this dynamically-evolving community white paper, we explore how the detailed performance of the anticipated science investigations is expected to depend on small changes to the LSST observing strategy. Using realistic simulations of the LSST schedule and observation properties, we design and compute diagnostic metrics and Figures of Merit that provide quantitative evaluations of different observing strategies, analyzing their impact on a wide range of proposed science projects. This is work in progress: we are using this white paper to communicate to each other the relative merits of the observing strategy choices that could be made, in an effort to maximize the scientific value of the survey. The investigation of some science cases leads to suggestions for new strategies that could be simulated and potentially adopted. Notably, we find motivation for exploring departures from a spatially uniform annual tiling of the sky: focusing instead on different parts of the survey area in different years in a "rolling cadence" is likely to have significant benefits for a number of time domain and moving object astronomy projects. The communal assembly of a suite of quantified and homogeneously coded metrics is the vital first step towards an automated, systematic, science-based assessment of any given cadence simulation, that will enable the scheduling of the LSST to be as well-informed as possible.},

@article{TheLIGOScientificCollaboration2017,
abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per {\$}8.0\backslashtimes10{\^{}}4{\$} years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, with the total mass of the system {\$}2.74{\^{}}{\{}+0.04{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.01{\}}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} (90{\%} probability) and had a luminosity distance of {\$}40{\^{}}{\{}+8{\}}{\_}{\{}-14{\}}{\$} Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

@article{Chamberlain2017,
abstract = {Gravitational waves encode invaluable information about the nature of the relatively unexplored extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational interaction is strong, non-linear and highly dynamical. Recent gravitational wave observations by advanced LIGO have provided the first glimpses into this regime, allowing for the extraction of new inferences on different aspects of theoretical physics. For example, these detections provide constraints on the mass of the graviton, Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector, the existence of large extra dimensions, the temporal variability of Newton's gravitational constant, and modified dispersion relations of gravitational waves. Many of these constraints, however, are not yet competitive with constraints obtained, for example, through Solar System observations or binary pulsar observations. In this paper, we study the degree to which theoretical physics inferences drawn from gravitational wave observations will strengthen with detections from future detectors. We consider future ground-based detectors, such as the LIGO-class expansions A+, Voyager, Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, as well as various configurations the space-based detector LISA. We find that space-based detectors will place constraints on General Relativity up to 12 orders of magnitude more stringently than current aLIGO bounds, but these space-based constraints are comparable to those obtained with the ground-based Cosmic Explorer or the Einstein Telescope. We also generically find that improvements in the instrument sensitivity band at low frequencies lead to large improvements in certain classes of constraints, while sensitivity improvements at high frequencies lead to more modest gains. These results strengthen the case for the development of future detectors, while providing additional information that could be useful in future design decisions.},

@article{Scolnic2017a,
abstract = {The discovery of a kilonova (KN) associated with the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)/Virgo event GW170817 opens up new avenues of multi-messenger astrophysics. Here, using realistic simulations, we provide estimates of the number of KNe that could be found in data from past, present and future surveys without a gravitational-wave trigger. For the simulation, we construct a spectral time-series model based on the DES-GW multi-band light-curve from the single known KN event, and we use an average of BNS rates from past studies of {\$}10{\^{}}3 \backslashrm{\{}Gpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}/\backslashrm{\{}year{\}}{\$}, consistent with the {\$}1{\$} event found so far. Examining past and current datasets from transient surveys, the number of KNe we expect to find for ASAS-SN, SDSS, PS1, SNLS, DES, and SMT is between 0 and {\$}0.3{\$}. We predict the number of detections per future survey to be: 8.3 from ATLAS, 10.6 from ZTF, 5.5/69 from LSST (the Deep Drilling / Wide Fast Deep), and 16.0 from WFIRST. The maximum redshift of KNe discovered for each survey is z = 0.8 for WFIRST, z = 0.25 for LSST and z = 0.04 for ZTF and ATLAS. For the LSST survey, we also provide contamination estimates from Type Ia and Core-collapse supernovae: after light-curve and template-matching requirements, we estimate a background of just 2 events. More broadly, we stress that future transient surveys should consider how to optimize their search strategies to improve their detection efficiency, and to consider similar analyses for GW follow-up programs.},

@article{Rosswog2016a,
abstract = {We study the optical and near-infrared luminosities and detectability of radioactively powered electromagnetic transients ('macronovae') occuring in the aftermath of binary neutron star and neutron star black hole mergers. We explore the transients that result from the dynamic ejecta and those from different types of wind outflows. Based on full nuclear network simulations we calculate the resulting light curves in different wavelength bands. We scrutinize the robustness of the results by comparing a) two different nuclear reaction networks and b) two macronova models. We explore in particular how sensitive the results are to the production of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei. We compare two frequently used mass models: the Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM) and the nuclear mass model of Duflo and Zuker (DZ31). We find that the abundance of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei has a significant impact on the observability of the resulting macronovae. For example, the DZ31 model yields considerably larger abundances resulting in larger heating rates and thermalization efficiencies and therefore predicts substantially brighter macronova transients. We find that the dynamic ejecta from NSNS models can reach peak K-band magnitudes in excess of -15 while those from NSBH cases can reach beyond -16. Similar values can be reached by some of our wind models. Several of our models (both wind and dynamic ejecta) yield properties that are similar to the transient that was observed in the aftermath of the short GRB 130603B. We further explore the expected macronova detection frequencies for current and future instruments such as VISTA, ZTF and LSST.},

@article{Rosswog2018,
abstract = {The astrophysical r-process site where about half of the elements heavier than iron are produced has been a puzzle for several decades. Here we discuss the role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct detection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) waves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double neutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based macronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the radioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with {\$}Y{\_}e \backslashlesssim 0.3{\$} (but not larger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the electromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular "nickel winds" as major source of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted either with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass together with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or indirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed a major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis. If the ejecta mass was {\{}$\backslash$em typical{\}}, NSMs can easily produce {\{}$\backslash$em all{\}} of the estimated Galactic r-process matter, and --depending on the real rate-- potentially even more. This could be a hint that the event ejected a particularly large amount of mass, maybe due to a substantial difference between the component masses. This would be compatible with the mass limits obtained from the GW-observation. The recent observations suggests that NSMs are responsible for a broad range of r-process nuclei and that they are at least a major, but likely the dominant r-process site in the Universe.},

@article{Villar2017b,
abstract = {We present the first effort to aggregate, homogenize, and uniformly model the combined ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared dataset for the electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. By assembling all of the available data from 18 different papers and 46 different instruments, we are able to identify and mitigate systematic offsets between individual datasets, and to identify clear outlying measurements, with the resulting pruned and adjusted dataset offering an opportunity to expand the study of the kilonova. The unified dataset includes 647 individual flux measurements, spanning 0.45 to 29.4 days post-merger, and thus has greater constraining power for physical models than any single dataset. We test a number of semi-analytical models and find that the data are well modeled with a three-component kilonova model: a "blue" lanthanide-poor component with Mej{\~{}}0.020 Msol and vej{\~{}}0.27c; an intermediate opacity "purple" component with Mej{\~{}}0.047 Msol and vej{\~{}}0.15c; and a "red" lanthanide-rich component with Mej{\~{}}0.011 Msol and vej{\~{}}0.14c. We further explore the possibility of ejecta asymmetry and its impact on the estimated parameters. From the inferred parameters we draw conclusions about the physical mechanisms responsible for the various ejecta components, the properties of the neutron stars, and, combined with an up-to-date merger rate, the implications for r-process enrichment via this channel. To facilitate future studies of this keystone event we make the unified dataset and our modeling code public.},

abstract = {We present the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) discovery of the optical counterpart of the first binary neutron star merger detected through gravitational wave emission, GW170817. Our observations commenced 10.5 hours post-merger, as soon as the localization region became accessible from Chile. We imaged 70 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} in the {\$}i{\$} and {\$}z{\$} bands, covering 93$\backslash${\%} of the initial integrated localization probability, to a depth necessary to identify likely optical counterparts (e.g., a kilonova). At 11.4 hours post-merger we detected a bright optical transient located {\$}10.6''{\$} from the nucleus of NGC$\backslash$,4993 at redshift {\$}z=0.0098{\$}, consistent (for {\$}H{\_}0 = 70{\$}$\backslash$, km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) with the distance of {\$}40 \backslashpm 8{\$}$\backslash$, Mpc reported by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration (LVC). At detection the transient had magnitudes {\$}i\backslashapprox 17.30{\$} and {\$}z\backslashapprox 17.45{\$}, and thus an absolute magnitude of {\$}M{\_}i = -15.7{\$}, in the luminosity range expected for a kilonova. We identified 1,500 potential transient candidates. Applying simple selection criteria aimed at rejecting background events such as supernovae, we find the transient associated with NGC$\backslash$,4993 as the only remaining plausible counterpart, and reject chance coincidence at the 99.5$\backslash${\%} confidence level. We therefore conclude that the optical counterpart we have identified near NGC$\backslash$,4993 is associated with GW170817. This discovery ushers in the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves, and demonstrates the power of DECam to identify the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources.},

@article{Wollaeger2017,
abstract = {The electromagnetic transients accompanying compact binary mergers ({\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-ray bursts, afterglows and 'macronovae') are crucial to pinpoint the sky location of gravitational wave sources. Macronovae are caused by the radioactivity from freshly synthesised heavy elements, e.g. from dynamic ejecta and various types of winds. We study macronova signatures by using multi-dimensional radiative transfer calculations. We employ the radiative transfer code SuperNu and state-of-the-art LTE opacities for a few representative elements from the wind and dynamical ejecta (Cr, Pd, Se, Te, Br, Zr, Sm, Ce, Nd, U) to calculate synthetic light curves and spectra for a range of ejecta morphologies. The radioactive power of the resulting macronova is calculated with the detailed input of decay products. We assess the detection prospects for our most complex models, based on the portion of viewing angles that are sufficiently bright, at different cosmological redshifts ({\$}z{\$}). The brighter emission from the wind is unobscured by the lanthanides (or actinides) in some of the models, permitting non-zero detection probabilities for redshifts up to {\$}z=0.07{\$}. We also find the nuclear mass model and the resulting radioactive heating rate are crucial for the detectability. While for the most pessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the ejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light curves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic heating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement. We conclude that future reliable macronova observations would constrain nuclear heating rates, and consequently help constrain nuclear mass models.},

abstract = {We present UV, optical, and NIR photometry of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source from Advanced LIGO/Virgo, the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Our data set extends from the discovery of the optical counterpart at {\$}0.47{\$} days to {\$}18.5{\$} days post-merger, and includes observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2 (GS/F2), and the {\{}$\backslash$it Hubble Space Telescope{\}} ({\{}$\backslash$it HST{\}}). The spectral energy distribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at {\$}0.6{\$} days is well described by a blackbody model with {\$}T\backslashapprox 8300{\$} K, a radius of {\$}R\backslashapprox 4.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of {\$}v\backslashapprox 0.3c{\$}), and a bolometric luminosity of {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm bol{\}}\backslashapprox 5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}41{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. At {\$}1.5{\$} days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and NIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands and significant reddening of the optical/NIR colors. Modeling the entire data set we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}56{\}}{\$}Ni, or those with only a single component of opacity from {\$}r{\$}-process elements, fail to capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead, models with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich ejecta provide a good fit to the data, the resulting "blue" component has {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\^{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}blue{\}}\backslashapprox 0.01{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and {\$}v{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\^{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}blue{\}}\backslashapprox 0.3{\$}c, and the "red" component has {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\^{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}red{\}}\backslashapprox 0.04{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and {\$}v{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}ej{\}}{\^{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}red{\}}\backslashapprox 0.1{\$}c.

@article{Abbott2017,
abstract = {The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17 August 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong signal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient signal within {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger observations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the gravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This approach does not require any form of cosmic "distance ladder;" the gravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be {\$}70.0{\^{}}{\{}+12.0{\}}{\_}{\{}-8.0{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}km{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (maximum a posteriori and 68{\%} credible interval). This is consistent with existing measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional standard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide precision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.},

abstract = {We present quantities which characterize the sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories to sources at cosmological distances. In particular, we introduce and generalize the horizon, range, response, and reach distances. These quantities incorporate a number of important effects, including cosmologically well-defined distances and volumes, cosmological redshift, cosmological time dilation, and rate density evolution. In addition, these quantities incorporate unique aspects of gravitational wave detectors, such as the variable sky sensitivity of the detectors and the scaling of the sensitivity with inverse distance. An online calculator (http://gwc.rcc.uchicago.edu) and python notebook (https://github.com/hsinyuc/distancetool) to determine GW distances are available. We provide answers to the question: "How far can gravitational-wave detectors hear?"},

abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\^{}}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\^{}}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\~{}}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\~{}}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

abstract = {Observations of type Ia supernovae at high redshifts have become an important tool for studying the geometry of the universe. The relation between the duration of the peak phase of a type Ia supernova's lightcurve and its luminosity (broader is brighter) forms the cornerstone of this measurement, yet it is a purely empirical relation. In this paper we show that the relation is a natural consequence of the radiation transport in type Ia supernovae and suggest constraints on the nature of the explosions which arise from our interpretation of the observed relation. The principle parameter underlying the relation is the mass of radioactive 56Ni produced in the explosion. The relation is shown to be relatively insensitive to most other parameters in Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. Cosmological results are thus unlikely to suffer from systematic effects stemming from evolution in the explosions' progenitors.},

abstract = {Material ejected during (or immediately following) the merger of two neutron stars may assemble into heavy elements by the r-process. The subsequent radioactive decay of the nuclei can power electromagnetic emission similar to, but significantly dimmer than, an ordinary supernova. Identifying such events is an important goal of future transient surveys, offering new perspectives on the origin of r-process nuclei and the astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. Predictions of the transient light curves and spectra, however, have suffered from the uncertain optical properties of heavy ions. Here we consider the opacity of expanding r-process material and argue that it is dominated by line transitions from those ions with the most complex valence electron structure, namely the lanthanides. For a few representative ions, we run atomic structure models to calculate radiative data for tens of millions of lines. We find that the resulting r-process opacities are orders of magnitude larger than that of ordinary (e.g., iron-rich) supernova ejecta. Radiative transport calculations using these new opacities indicate that the transient emission should be dimmer and redder than previously thought. The spectra appear pseudo-blackbody, with broad absorption features, and peak in the infrared ({\~{}}1 micron). We discuss uncertainties in the opacities and attempt to quantify their impact on the spectral predictions. The results have important implications for observational strategies to find and study the radioactively powered electromagnetic counterparts to compact object mergers.},

@article{Davis2010,
abstract = {We present an analysis of peculiar velocities and their effect on supernova cosmology. In particular, we study (a) the corrections due to our own motion, (b) the effects of correlations in peculiar velocities induced by large-scale structure, and (c) uncertainties arising from a possible local under- or over-density. For all of these effects we present a case study of their impact on the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova redshifts for the CMB dipole slightly over-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. We show that while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived equation of state of Delta w {\~{}} 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additional local-motion correction is currently negligible (Delta w{\textless}0.01). We use a covariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar velocities. This down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as a graduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent velocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of {\~{}}2{\%} in the preferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully when future surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. Finally, we perform n-body simulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation (monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff. We see that for this aspect the low-z cutoff of z=0.02 is well-justified theoretically, but that living in a putative local density fluctuation leaves an indelible imprint on the magnitude-redshift relation.},

	abstract = {The LSST community is invited to play a key role in the definition of LSST’s Observ- ing Strategy by submitting white papers to help refine the ‘main survey’ and fully define the use of 10-20\% of time expected to be devoted to various ‘mini surveys’ (including the ‘Deep Drilling mini surveys’ and ‘Target of Opportunity’ programs). The LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD) places minimal constraints on the ob- serving strategy, recognizing that science evolves and that the initial (by now more than a decade old) survey strategy would have to be redefined closer to first light. With LSST first light expected in 2020, and the LSST operations phase starting in 2022, now is the time to undertake the final planning for the initial LSST observing strategy. While the existing candidate baseline survey strategy has been primarily defined by the LSST Project, the final planning must be undertaken hand-in-hand with the community. We seek science-driven input for observing strategy proper- ties such as the sky coverage, per-bandpass imaging depth, temporal coverage, and various detailed observing constraints. There are no specific limitations on what kind of science programs will be considered, except that the four primary LSST sci- ence themes must remain the cornerstones of the LSST survey. This document is a solicitation for white papers to help plan these aspects of the LSST survey strategy. The deadline for white paper submission is November 30, 2018.},

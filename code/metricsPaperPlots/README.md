# Metrics Paper Plots

These are the tools used to create the plots for the metrics paper [Lochner et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05676). There are some required packages that can be easily installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The main useful notebook is `os-comparison-plots-v2.ipynb` which aims to reproduce the plots from the paper but for the v2.0 and v2.1 simulations.

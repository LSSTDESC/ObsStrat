# obs_strat
Charter
———
To respond to the white paper call (https://www.lsst.org/call-whitepaper-2018) on behalf of DESC.

Deliverables
——

Two white papers, one focused on WFD and one focused on DDF and other mini-Surveys, to be led by Michelle Lochner and Dan Scolnic.


Contents
——
The created template for each white paper is here: https://github.com/lsst-pst/survey_strategy_wp/blob/master/WP_submission_template.tex#L84

This is from the Project which wants to standardize responses.  The sections are:
[
a. Abstract —
Please provide a short summary of your scientific goals and survey strategy modifications here.

b. General Information —
Author Info, Science Category, Survey Type Category, Observing Strategy Category

c.  Scientific Motivation  —
Describe the scientific justification for this white paper in the context of your field, as well as the importance to the general program of astronomy,
including the relevance over the next decade. Describe other relevant data, and justify why LSST is the best facility for these observations.

d.  Technical Description —
Describe your survey strategy modifications or proposed observations. Please comment on each observing constraint below, including the technical motivation behind any constraints. Where relevant, indicate if the constraint applies to all requested observations or a specific subset. Please note which constraints are not relevant or important for your science goals.

e. Performance Evaluation -
Please describe how to evaluate the performance of a given survey in achieving your desired science goals, ideally as a heuristic tied directly to the observing strategy (e.g. number of visits obtained within a window of time with a specified set of filters) with a clear link to the resulting effect on science.

f. Special Data Processing --
Describe any data processing requirements beyond the standard LSST Data Management pipelines and how these will be achieved.

-----

The template itself is fairly constrictive about wanting final results rather than the process of these results were come to. Since we have to go through the process, here is what we feel we need to add and what we ask of each WG:


Each white paper will have the following:
Add:  A section on the strategies considered, including detailed information about all the information we needed to add to the white paper call (e.g., locations for different fields) that would be assessed by each group.

Add from each group 2-3 page description:

  i.  Brief introduction of motivation of each probe and what is unique to LSST
  
  ii. How analysis was done/ code was used [Please link to Jupyter notebook]
  
  iii.  Justification of the metric
 
 iv.  Explanation of preferences of working group with qualifiers about how good/bad strategies are

v.  What is needed to know if people outside group use the metric as is without consultation

  vi.  How would external data change rankings/metric?
  
  vii. What is further work / slight modifications to survey strategy thought about?
  
Add: Summarized rankings of different strategies/choices considered ranging from ‘Ideal’ to ‘Science Disabling’.  Associated Figure-of-merits with each choice given if possible.

Add: Summary of how external (non-LSST) can be used, and what changes in terms of final rankings/preferences assuming external data






Calendar
———

July 19, Task Force Meeting.  Presentation of additional information needed for call response.

July 24, CMU ObsStrat XWG Session at 11:00.  July 26, CMU ObsStrat XWG Session at 09:00.

->July 25, Settled list of additional information needed for appropriate response to call

Aug 2, Task Force Meeting

->August 10, First assessment of subset of WFD and mini-survey strategies, with metrics.  Slides from each WG.

Aug 13-16 - LSST Community Workshop including multiple ObsStrat sessions

Aug 16, Task Force Meeting

Aug 30, Task Force Meeting

[By September may change frequency/dates of meetings as semester starts]

->Sep 15, Full assessment of strategies and metrics due for task force

Sep 17-19, LSST Cadence Hackathon at Flatiron (https://www.lsstcorporation.org/node/193).  Need to apply.

->Oct 1, Full white papers sent back to task force for response

->Oct 15, Responses from task force due.

->Oct 25, Revised white papers sent out to DESC.

->Nov 5, Responses from DESC due.

->Nov 30, !!!!White Papers due!!!

The key takeaways are a first take due August 10 before the community workshop so we can present to the Project any issues we might have, and a full assessment by September 15.  Than iterations over the next two months with white papers sent out to all of DESC on Oct 25.


Additional Information
———
In the above, we mention additional information.  By that we mean that there are a number of pieces of information we as a group need to fill in about the call.  We are asking the following people to prepare this for our next meeting:

1.  Location of WFD - Humna Awan.

2.  Location of DDFs - David Rubin.

3.  List of WFD strategies not in white paper call - Michelle Lochner

4.  Cadence of DDF - Philippe Gris

5.  Special calibration observations - Nicolas Regnault

6.  ToO Capability - Marcelle Soares-Santos

1-4 will likely go in section C above.  5 and 6 may have their own dedicated place within the DDF and mini-surveys response. 

For 1-4, we are asking these people to come up with a contained menu of options that each group can consider as part of their response.  We would like to have this settled by the CMU meeting, with presentation on July 19.
-----------------


Working with other surveys
———

-For each of our white papers, we will have a dedicated section on the benefits of external datasets.  This will include ones from Euclid, WFIRST and other spectroscopic surveys.  
-Our process will be totally transparent and our github page will be public - there is nothing that needs to be hidden about our deliberations.  However, we want to maintain a ‘unified front’ within DESC, so we ask for everyone to refrain from stating any conclusions of the task force until these conclusions have been reached.
-Endorsement of strategies outside of DESC will be done within the DESC white papers.
